## New Pin Configuration

### I2C Pins (STEMMA QT)
```
ESP32 ProS3:
  SDA: GPIO 8 (STEMMA QT connector)
  SCL: GPIO 9 (STEMMA QT connector)
  Address: 0x42
```

### ProS3-Specific Hardware
```
RGB LED:     GPIO 48 (built-in NeoPixel)
VBAT Monitor: GPIO 4 (battery voltage, optional)
LDO2 Enable:  GPIO 17 (second regulator control)
```

---

## Wiring Options

### Option 1: STEMMA QT Connector (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Plug-and-play with STEMMA QT cable
- No soldering on ProS3 side
- Reversible connector
- Clean installation

**Cons:**
- Need SAO-to-STEMMA QT adapter cable (different pinouts)

### Option 2: Direct GPIO Wiring

**Pros:**
- Standard 4-wire connection
- Works with existing SAO port

**Cons:**
- Requires soldering to GPIO headers
- Less convenient than STEMMA QT

## Firmware Changes

### Before (Multi-Board Support):
```cpp
// Uncomment ONE of these:
// #define BOARD_PROS3
#define BOARD_XIAO_C6  // default
// #define BOARD_XIAO_S3

#if defined(BOARD_PROS3)
  #define I2C_SDA 8
  #define I2C_SCL 9
#else
  #define I2C_SDA 6
  #define I2C_SCL 7
#endif
```

### After (ProS3-Only):
```cpp
// ESP32 ProS3 only
#define I2C_SDA 8      // STEMMA QT SDA
#define I2C_SCL 9      // STEMMA QT SCL
#define RGB_LED_PIN 48 // Built-in LED
```

**Result:** Simpler, cleaner, no conditional compilation!

## Questions?

**Q: Can I still use XIAO ESP32-C6/S3?**
A: The project now exclusively supports ProS3. XIAO support was removed to simplify development and documentation. See `BOARD_COMPARISON.md` for why ProS3 was chosen.

**Q: What if I already have a XIAO board?**
A: You can still use it, but you'll need to modify the firmware's I2C pin definitions from GPIO8/9 back to GPIO6/7, and you won't benefit from the ProS3-specific optimizations.

**Q: Is the ProS3 worth the higher cost?**
A: Yes! 16MB Flash (vs 4MB) and 8MB PSRAM (vs none) make a huge difference for web interfaces and graphics. The STEMMA QT connector and dual LDOs are also major advantages.

**Q: Can I use the STEMMA QT connector directly?**
A: Yes! Just note that SAO and STEMMA QT have different pinouts (power pins are swapped). You may need a custom adapter cable, or wire directly to GPIO8/9.
